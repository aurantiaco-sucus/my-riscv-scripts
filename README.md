# My RISC-V Scripts
This is my personal collection of scripts related to RISC-V software adaption & development. Primary aim here is to record the scripts I used in my experiments so that I would not need to repeat them in the shell. These are presented to you with absolutely no guarantee whatsoever about their usability, performance or even correctness, and I take no responability if you bricked your device somehow using these. It's advised to review the actual commands before execution. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

## Catalogue
* `revyos-llvm` - Scripts to compile bleeding-edge LLVM toolset inside a RevyOS installation. Tested to fail at about 2/3 progress, apparantly due to outdated host LLVM toolchain.
* `revyos-ppsspp` - Scripts to compile bleeding-edge PPSSPP with GLES support inside a RevyOS installation. Not tested yet.
* `dep.ruyi.sh` - Create a GNU environment with Ruyi SDK for cross-compilation.
* `dep.ruyi.llvm.sh` - Create a LLVM environment with Ruyi SDK for cross-compilation.
